# KattisProblems
Python solutions of some of the kattis problems

These are all my own solutions. Some of the problems are not suited for Python because of the cpu time limit of kattis, therefore if they don't get past i just simply converted them to C++ for execution speed.
Please don't copy paste, just look at how i solved the problem then write your own code. All codes are listed in question names, however i shortened some of them because of file character limit.
