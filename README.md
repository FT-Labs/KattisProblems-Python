# <h1> Python solutions of some of the kattis problems 

These are all my own solutions. Some of the problems are not suited for Python because of the cpu time limit of kattis, therefore if they don't get past i just simply converted them to C++ for execution speed.
Please don't copy paste, just look at how i solved the problem then write your own code. All codes are listed in question names, however i shortened some of them because of file character limit.


If you don't understand the codes i write, please watch data structures and algorithm videos. I prefer Abdul Bari on youtube for algorithms, he is the best teacher you can learn competitive programming from.

Also, if you prefer Kotlin as your language i solved some with Kotlin too, you can check my other repository. However normally Kotlin should be faster than Python because it is a compiled language which works with JVM, but on Kattis Python is much much faster than Kotlin. **Therefore, i recommend you to use difficulty<=3.5 Kotlin is okay, but if you are going to try harder problems >3.5, use Python or C++.**
